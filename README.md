# BTMA417 Final Project

On average, natural disasters kill approximately 60,000 people around the world every year. In terms of impacts, natural disasters can cause property destruction, economic losses, and personal injury. In less developed countries, the loss of security, resources, and access to shelter can also lead to massive relocation  

This project seeks heighten awareness of the frequency and impacts that natural disasters can have on society and ways to mitigate these risks. By estimating the relationship between certain types of natural disaster and variables such as locations, population, and frequency of occurrences, government officials can better revise and create scientifically informed contingency plans for their countries. Indeed, accurate risk mitigation initiatives could help minimize negative impacts such as deaths and economic losses. The investigation of this topic is also beneficial for geophysicist and meteorologists who monitor natural disasters and need to gain insights on environmental patterns as well as for sociologists wanting to understand the effect that natural disasters have on human behavior.
